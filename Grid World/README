RUNNING TESTS:

  Place your implementation of GridWorld.h into
  a directory containing all of these files.

  You can run the tests individually or in
  'batch' mode by running the script run_tests.
  The script will produce a subdirectory called
  _TEST_RESULTS containing summaries of the
  tests.


         IMPORTANT SIDE NOTE:  the file run_tests is a bash script
         and must have "executable permission" to run as shown
         above.

         As given, it does have executable permission, but if
         you download it directly, your downloaded version may
         not have executable permission (kind of a safety thing
         I suppose).
